# Blood-Bank-Application
This is a small project that I created in PHP as a part of an assignment round by Internshala. It is a blood bank application with seperate portals for Receivers and Hospitals. Hospitals can add available blood samples and check the sample requests raised by receivers. Meanwhile receivers can also view the different samples possessed by all the hospitals and can raise requests for them as long as the sample's type matches their blood type.
